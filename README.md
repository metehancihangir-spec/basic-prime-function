# My First GitHub Project

A simple Python program that checks whether a number entered by the user is prime or not.  
This project was created as my very first GitHub repository while learning Python basics.

---

## üîß How It Works
- The program defines a function `prime_number_checker()` that:
  - Asks the user to input a number
  - Returns a message saying whether the number is prime or not

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example Usage

When you run the program, it will prompt:

```text
Write a number: 7
7 is a prime number
