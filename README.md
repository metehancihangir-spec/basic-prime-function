Simple Python function to check if a number is prime.
# Prime Number Checker

This is a simple Python project that checks whether a given number is prime or not.  
It was created as one of my first GitHub repositories to practice Python basics and version control.

---

## üîß How It Works
- The program defines a function `is_prime(n)` that:
  - Returns `True` if the number is prime
  - Returns `False` otherwise

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example Usage

```python
from prime_checker import is_prime

print(is_prime(7))   # True
print(is_prime(10))  # False
